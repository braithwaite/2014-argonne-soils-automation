Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" (Mac version)
===========================================================

OK, so you've created a running computer.  How do you get to it?

The main thing you'll need is the network name of your new computer.
To retrieve this, go to the instance view and click on the instance,
and find the "Public DNS".  This is the public name of your computer
on the Internet.

Copy this name, and connect to that computer with ssh under the username
'ubuntu', as follows.

First, get the private key file from here: `soils.pem <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~trimble/nodi/soils.pem>`__

It should be a .pem file in your Downloads 
folder.  Move it onto your desktop.

Next, start Terminal (in Applications... Utilities...) and type::

  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/soils.pem

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/soils.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(Where you need to put your IP numbers here)

Here, you're logging in as user 'ubuntu' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'amazon.pem' on your Desktop.


Note, you have to replace the stuff after the '@' sign with the name
of the host; see the red circle in:

At the end you should see text and a prompt that look like this:
