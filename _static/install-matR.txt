Take-aways
----------

1.  R is a good investment: any quantitative analysis (visualization) at your fingertips

2.  MG-RAST makes starting with R easy:  matR

3.  matR interfaces easily with other R and non-R tools

4.  a few examples

5.  how to get started


Install matR from GitHub (for the latest version)
-------------------------------------------------

Install R itself, first.  (go to:  http://www.r-project.org)
Start R, then:
> chooseCRANmirror (gr=FALSE)       # when asked, choose the option nearest to you
> install.packages ("devtools")
> library("devtools")
> install_github ("MG-RAST/matR", dependencies=TRUE)
> q()                               # when asked, answer "n"

Done!  Now any time you run R, you can load matR with:
> library (matR)

Then you can replay today's session with:
> step.through('whyR')
> step.through('ant')
> step.through('simple')
> step.through('API')               # use "q" to quit at the end


Follow-Up
---------
If your system says something is "missing", for instance the package "RJSONIO", try:
> install.packages("RJSONIO")

Or try this:
> library(matR)
> dependencies()			# then follow the directions
