Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" 
===========================================================

OK, so we have rented a computer for you.  It will be yours
alone for the rest of the day, and it is a blank slate.
It doesn't have blast (yet) and doesn't have any data.

The network name of your new computer we gave you on a scrap
of paper.

Copy this name, and connect to that computer with ssh under the username
'ubuntu', as follows.

First, get the private key file from here: `soils.pem <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~trimble/nodi/soils.pem>`__

It should be a .pem file in your Downloads 
folder.  Move it onto your desktop.

Next, start Terminal (for mac) or gitbash (for windows) and type::

  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/soils.pem

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".  

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/soils.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(Where you need to put your IP numbers here)

Here, you're logging in as user 'ubuntu' to the machine
'ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'soils.pem' on your Desktop.


Note, you have to replace the stuff after the '@' sign with the name
of the host; see the red circle in:

At the end you should see text and a prompt that look like this:
