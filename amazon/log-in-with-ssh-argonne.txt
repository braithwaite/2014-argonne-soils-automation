Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" 
===========================================================

OK, so we have rented a computer for you.  It will be yours
alone for the rest of the day, and it is a blank slate.
It doesn't have blast (yet) and doesn't have any data.

If you are on windows and weren't here yesterday, you need to 
**install `git bash <http://msysgit.github.io/>`__.**

The network name of your new computer we gave you on a scrap
of paper.

Copy this name, and connect to that computer with ssh **with the username
'ubuntu'** 

First, you must download the private key file from here: `soils.pem <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~trimble/nodi/soils.pem>`__

It should be a .pem file in your Downloads 
folder.  Move it onto your desktop.

Next, start Terminal (for mac) or gitbash (for windows) and type::
 
  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/soils.pem

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".  

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/soils.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(Where you need to put the address for your machine, distributed on a 
sheet of paper, here)

This command attempts to log in as user 'ubuntu' to the machine
'ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'soils.pem' on your Desktop.

At the end you should see text and a prompt that look like this:

.. image:: ../images/victory-win.png
   :width: 50%

.. image:: ../images/victory-mac.png
   :width: 50%

Congratulations, you now have CONTROL of your own EC2 server.
